  <p class="intro">Venerables, these seven cases that are settlements of legal issues come up for recitation.</p>

  <p>For the calming, for the stilling of whichever legal issues have arisen: the removal through the presence [of the bhikkhu] is to be given, the removal [of the accusation] through remembrance is to be given, the removal [of the accusation] through not [being] insane is to be given, he is to be made to do [the offence procedure] through admitting [the offence], the [decision of the] majority, [the decision making it] worse for him, [the decision] covering [the offences as if] with grass.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Recited, Venerables, have been the seven cases that are settlements of legal issues.<br/> Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?<br/> A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?<br/> A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?<br/> The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I keep this [in mind].<br/></p>

  <p class="outro">The cases that are settlements of legal issues have finished</p>
