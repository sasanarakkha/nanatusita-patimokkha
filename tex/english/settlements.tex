\section{Settlements of Legal Issues}
\label{settlements}

\begin{center}
  Venerables, these seven cases that are settlements of legal issues come up for recitation.
\end{center}

For the calming, for the stilling of whichever legal issues have arisen: the removal through the presence [of the bhikkhu] is to be given, the removal [of the accusation] through remembrance is to be given, the removal [of the accusation] through not [being] insane is to be given, he is to be made to do [the offence procedure] through admitting [the offence], the [decision of the] majority, [the decision making it] worse for him, [the decision] covering [the offences as if] with grass.

\medskip

\begin{center}
Recited, Venerables, have been the seven cases that are settlements of legal issues.

\smallskip

Concerning that I ask the Venerables: [Are you] pure in this?\\
A second time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?\\
A third time again I ask: [Are you] pure in this?

\smallskip

The venerables are pure in this, therefore there is silence, thus I keep this [in mind].
